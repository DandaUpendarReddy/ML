For some reason , I guess it's just cheaper to make it here and make a bigger profit. Also, Americans are very easily pleased. Look at the size of us. We'll eat anything , as long as it is loaded with fat on top. So, after that being said, This sauce is good, as long as you doctor it up a bit with your own spices.

Amazon product description says it is.  Years ago, you could buy in the United States many brands of Italian white clam sauce  from Italy in a can. Those were far superior to anything sold today. For some reason , I guess it's just cheaper to make it here and make a bigger profit. Also, Americans are very easily pleased. Look at the size of us. We'll eat anything , as long as it is loaded with fat on top. So, after that being said, This sauce is good, as long as you doctor it up a bit with your own spices.

He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally.

Well, the truth is that I am a true Coke connoisseur.  I have spent many hours discussing a good coca-cola versus a crap coca-cola. This is a drink that can draw out the flavors of a good meal, just like a fine bottle of wine or cold glass of milk.<br /><br />Originally I only drank regular Coke. But there is no need to have all that high fructose corn syrup. It will ultimately lead to your demise.  So make the switch to Diet Coke. You may need to do some 50/50 blends for a while, but in a couple of weeks you won\\'t go back to regular Coke (it tastes way too sugary now).  In general, any soda from a can actually can taste pretty bad due to changes in carbonation, flavor of the can, etc.  But a soda from a bottle (glass or plastic) is the best.  You know the batch is good when there is a major burn in your mouth after a big gulp.  Pepsi won\\'t do this the same, the pH is different and it has a different sugar content.  Diet Coke has the perfect burn.  Fountain soda almost universally sucks, so don\\'t even go there.<br /><br />I recommend that D.C. accompany any rich, flavorful meal.  It may overpower meals that have subtle flavors (for example, some French cuisine is quite subtle in flavor to me, and D.C. may wash it away).  You already know D.C. will enhance the flavors of beef, fried food, pizza, potato chips (and most other snacks), most sandwiches, Italian foods of almost any variety, and greasy chili cheese dogs.<br /><br />So go buy a 2 liter, chill (4 degrees celsius at the lowest, preferably a degree or two warmer), go work off all that high fructose corn syrup you ate earlier in the day, and then getcha pull of D.C.<br /><br />If you don\\'t like my review, you must be a Pepsi fan.  So be it.  Your teeth will rot sooner, it\\'s got a lower pH.'],\n",

McCann's Steel Cut oatmeal is very tasty and I like the texture a lot. You cannot even compare this to instant oatmeal.<br /><br />I cooked mine in the programmable coffee maker. Before going to bed I put 1/2 cup of oats and a pinch of salt in the carafe, added water per cooking instructions on the box to the coffee maker's reservoir, and set the timer to start brewing the next day 30 minutes before I usually have breakfast. It all worked perfectly. I just scooped it out of the carafe into a bowl, added some blueberry preserves, and had a great breakfast.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product.\"],\n",

For people in the same boat, consider yourself warned that this beverage is NOTHING like coffee.<br /><br />As to its merits as a distinct drink, I'd have to say I'm still not a fan.  It's bitter like the previous reviewer has pointed out, but this bitterness is not (in my experience) alleviated by stevia.  While I'm usually a great fan of mint, this drink has a spoiled aftertaste which lingers on the tongue and is interlaced with nutty undertones.  There's not the slightest hint of chocolate, which is a shame because raw cocoa powder would be less bitter than this concoction.<br /><br />If the taste were slightly more obnoxious, I'd say it was medicinal, but as it stands, it might be possible to disguise the poor flavors using cream or sugar.  However, I think I'll just save my money and continue on my search for a coffee alternative which I actually enjoy drinking.<br /><br />This isn't to write Teeccino as a brand off; I'd suggest ordering the sampler pack from their website in order to make an informed decision rather than pin all your hopes and dreams to one large tub of a single flavor.\"],\n",

The third ingredient is evaporated cane juice, which is unusual.<br /><br />Hot or cold, this soup tastes good. The carton is made of paper (environment-friendly) and has a resealable lid. The rectangular shape is easy to store in the fridge, although the spout isn't the best design for pouring. Some of the soup dribbled down the side after I finished pouring a serving into my bowl. Sodium content is a bit high, at 26% of your recommended daily intake per serving. They are counting 2/3 cup as a serving, which is not realistic for a hungry person. There are 6 servings in here. 1 serving is 70 calories (20 from fat).<br /><br />The only ingredient I didn't recognize is disodium inosinate.

The freeze-dried ones contain a tad more sugars (15 vs 21) but the fiber and potassium are right on.<br /><br />Personally, I hate the texture of fresh bananas, but love the banana taste so these crunchy treats were wonderful.  The package clearly states that they are freeze-dried, which is VERY different from a dried fruit.  If you have not before had freeze-dried bananas, try a single pack!  Dried fruit can either be crunchy-hard or soft and pliable, of which these are neither.  They get gummy if you suck on them, so I can see them being a good treat for older infants/young toddlers with fewer teeth.<br /><br />The cinnamon was a nice touch to the banana, and not overwhelming at all.  My 3 1/2 year old tried to eat a whole bag without sharing, and now that I\\'ve compared to the \"real\" thing, I will let her!  These are going to be great to have on the run when a fresh banana just won\\'t make it (like in the glove box during a WI winter).  The cost will prevent us from making these more common in our household, but with an expiration date 2 1/2 years away... well, a case would never last my child that long anyhow!'],\n",

With this product we were able to give it to them within 1 hour to going out and they remained calm and quiet. We left the hotel room and the girls just sat their on the bed.  They were not groggy or sleepy just peaceful and calm. they did not even bark when someone walked passed the room window.

I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country\\'s food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled \"Made in Thailand\".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don\\'t eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats\\' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don\\'t eat it, so I don\\'t plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company\\'s effort...they can\\'t please every cat\\'s taste buds!'],\n",

I love chocolate, almonds, and marzipan.<br /><br />I did wonder how there would be enough filling to taste the marzipan without it oozing out.  No worries there because the marzipan is a fairly thin layer encapsulated in thick layers of dark chocolate.<br /><br />When I took that first bite, I thought, \"Something isn\\'t right here.\"  It didn\\'t taste bad, but it didn\\'t taste great to me.  The chocolate is scrumptious, but the marzipan seemed, well, treacly.  My husband wasn\\'t impressed either.  We both thought the candy tasted OK but we weren\\'t wowed.<br /><br />I decided to take a poll.  I brought eight bars to work and put them on the break room table.  It\\'s also our meeting room table, and it\\'s where we put treats to share.  There are two possible outcomes of bringing in a treat to my office.  One is that some or all of my coworkers will ooh and ah and carry on about how delicious the treat is.  The other outcome is deadly silence.  These people enjoy food, and they will eat anything.  But if they don\\'t like something, they don\\'t say a word.  The candy bars disappeared, and not one word was said.  My coworkers were not impressed, either!<br /><br />I kept tasting and tasting to determine what bothered me so much.  It seemed there was almond extract in it.  It tastes like there is almond extract to me, and almond extract is a very strong, sweet flavor.  It\\'s true the candy is made with almonds.  Almonds are listed in the ingredients, but so are \"natural flavors.\"  Maybe it isn\\'t almond extract, but I think something in the natural flavors gives the candy an off taste.<br /><br />It\\'s been over a month since I bought the case, and I still have a couple bars left.  The chocolate is excellent, but that filling - meh.  I\\'m a lifelong chocoholic, and I just don\\'t crave this candy.  I wouldn\\'t mind trying other Ritter Sport chocolates, and I wouldn\\'t tell you not to try this product, but I wouldn\\'t recommend it either.'],\n",

Foam like texture with tough outer covering.  In theory, biting through the outer covering and squishing into the inner foam is supposed to help keep teeth clean.  Hard to tell if they are effective but I\\'m too lazy to brush his teeth and figure this is better than nothing.  He is fed Wellness wet food only.  I strongly believe kibble is bad for animal teeth since it doesn\\'t clean their teeth while chewing and all the carbs simply make a nice paste on teeth providing an excellent environment for plaque forming bacteria.  Seriously, would you replace your tooth brush with hard cookies?  Consider the residue from Oreos?  I\\'ve seen kibble fed teeth and they aren\\'t pretty.  We\\'ve been using this product for a few years.  Our cat is nine years old and finally needed his first professional teeth cleaning earlier this year.  The dental chews have a strong odor and oily residue that sticks to your fingers but easily washes off with simple water and friction.  He attacks and bats them around the floor for a second then devours them quickly.  I usually give him one each day.'],\n",

And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.

I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine.

       "  ' Given the lack of response to some key criticisms, though relatively few, of this food, I\\'ll focus my review on why this nutritional powerhouse is classified as a SUPERfood and why, for what are obvious reasons, some folks do not like this awesome Organic Raw Maca. Maca is surely classified as a superfood, and why that is the case pertains to its exceptional potency. General speaking, the \"better\" a superfood tastes, the lower (that\\'s right, the lower) the nutritional density. And why would this be the case? Well, simply because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as Maca, chlorella, spirulina, broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas, processed fruit juices, etc.<br />Fortunately, since it\\'s abundantly obvious to me that not everything that\\'s good for me is going to taste like a Ritter Sport chocolate bar, I\\'ve been able to get past the subjective definitions or pronouncements on Maca\\'s taste or flavor -- and most reviews by far out there, by the way, indicate a much more neutral, even positive assessment of Maca\\'s taste. I for one, like so many Americans, want really good and sustainable energy, not the kind that comes at any kind of unnatural price, e.g., sudden crashes, nervousness, the jitters, stomach aches, headaches, cramps, etc. Fortunately through Maca, I\\'ve found significantly increased energy, overall alertness, focus, and enhanced powers of concentration....not to mention the physical energy for my lengthy & strenuous workouts. Though I jus\\' luvs me my coffee, there are numerous ways of getting that energy without the price of the smaller dives, total crashes and inevitable burn-outs.<br />If this entirely natural, special Maca-kind-of-boost is not important to you, then you don\\'t need to try it.<br /><br />Having communicated all this, careful readers of all of the reviews here will probably be able to see why some do not like Organic Raw Maca Powder, often linked to questions about taste, culinary expectations, etc. To note, it\\'s difficult for me to place much weight on reviews by those who have tried out a food (and I view Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, not as a product, but as an exceptional nutritional food) for only a few days (only 3!, in some instances) or a few weeks. Generally speaking, the better a superfood tastes, the lower the nutritional density, and this is because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as wheat grass, spinach, barley grass, chlorella, spirulina, green tea (extract), broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas or processed fruit juices.'],\n",

If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.\"],\n",

The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.\"],\n",

I put them in baked goods, in rice pilaff (with allspice and onions for an Armenian pilaff) in chick pea salads to add a touch of sweetness to a savory dish, in wild rice and farro salad, in a braised chicken dish with lots of onions, etc. You get the idea. They are not just for baking. You can be creative and add a handful wherever you want a bit of sweetness in a savory dish. Because they are tiny they can be a bit dry so it's best to soak them and drain them well before using. Or keep them in a container in the refrigerator after you've soaked and drained the entire box. That way they are ready to toss into whatever you are cooking that day.\"],\n",

Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).\"],\n",

Maybe because of the maple syrup added (I can't resist maple) that gives it an extra kick of goodness that regular almond butter doesn't have.<br /><br />Since I'm into good health - this almond butter was like dessert/treat for me.  I had 1 slice sourdough bread, topped it with this slightly toasted, slightly sweetened almond butter then topped it with the wheat sprouts I grow.  It was wonderful and knocked my chocolate craving away. (since I haven't eaten chocolate in months I wasn't craving it too badly)  I like this much better than Nutella and I'll switch to this for my treats.  Tastes delicious right off your spoon.  You do have to stir this up as there was an oil layer on top. (I'm in hot California)<br /><br />I would love to try the regular almond butter...maybe next time...or not.  I'm loving this one for now.  I'm weaning off of peanuts so this one here is excellent when you are used to Skippy Chunky...although no chunks in this...it may be a bit too sweet for you if you are sensitive to sugars.

No need for a third, they have just enough crunch to get me through a quickie morning break and are sweet enough for an after dinner dessert.  They even change my outlook, I feel somewhat refined dipping my biscoff into my coffee, my cup doesn't match my saucer and they are both chipped and old, but still, they wouldn't taste any better served from Wedgewood china.<br /><br />Best of all, I found these cookies at my local grocery store.  My store has a nice little selection of holiday foods out for Thanksgiving, you know the stuff, things like packets of mulling spices, pretty jars of marmalade, bottles of sparkling cider and eggnog flavored tea and nestled in amongst the plum ham glaze and cartons of bright green fruitcake cherries were white packages of biscoff, they were a great price too, 25% off!  When I went back to the store two days later to stock up, I found jars of Biscoff spread for three dollars each, SCORE!

A slightly bitter taste is actually something I enjoy, as opposed to overly sweetened coffee that seem to be the rage.  This little can (6.8 FL OZ) certainly has that.  It has a surprisingly bitter taste with just the right amount of sweetness.  At 50 calories a can, it\\'s relatively diet friendly too.<br /><br />But there, at least for me, was something of a strange film in my mouth.  Not a big deal, but at almost $2 per can ($22.93 for 12) I expect to like it much more than I did.

I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.

Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.\"],\n",

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.\"],\n",

I researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food. No one in my area, Lancaster PA. has this product. I sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet. After only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm. I am so thankful. She is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes.'],\n",

       "  ' I have two rescue chihuahua mix dogs (2yr old chiweenie 19 lbs. & 7mo jack-chi 9.6 lbs.). Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We\\'ve stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they\\'re both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the \"right\" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they\\'ll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn\\'t experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we\\'ve had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn\\'t \"love\" it, he\\'ll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We\\'ve only just bought some a few days go so I\\'ll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food. This is amazing because our oldest has always seemed to tolerate his kibble but hasn\\'t ever loved any brands we\\'ve tried to date. This is the first time he\\'s started eating a new food immediately!! My bf is also happy bc he would rather feed them the same thing than to have separate kinds for each like we were doing. I\\'m pretty sure we\\'ve found the \"it\" food that works for us!!!'],\n",

Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared, so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way, what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman\\'s.

However, I was curious how they would affect the taste, if at all.<br /><br />I am happy to report that this Splenda tastes great.  Normally I use the pink stuff in my coffee and iced tea, and I never found that one packet was as sweet as 2 teaspoons of sugar.  Splenda also says that one packet = 2 tsp., and in this case it's true.  My morning coffee was exceptional today.  The research is ongoing but at this point Splenda seems to be healthier than some of the other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />On the down side, yeah, it's pretty expensive.  You can probably find other ways to get 1 gram of fiber pretty easily.  Also the individual packets are lined in foil.  If you are conscious of over-packaging this might make you crazy.<br /><br />In the final analysis this is a 4-star product.  Mainly, it does what it is supposed to - sweeten food and beverages.

It adds texture, flavor, and a small amount of added nutrients from the seeds in the mixture. Shichimi in Japan usually contains hemp seed as one of the 7 ingredients, which gives the spice a good crunch. For export to the US, this ingredient has been replaced. Aside from that, this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite.<br /><br />Be sure to put the cap back on tightly after use so that no moisture gets into the bottle. When that happens, the powdered ingredients will start to stick together and become difficult to shake out of the hole.\"],\n",

Something  advertised as a \"Protein Water Mix\" should dissolve in water!!! Another small gripe, while I\\'m at it- each serving is in a skinny straw-like package with a tear off opening- that does not open wide enough to let the powder sprinkle out- so I have to find a pair of scissors to open it enough to use it- making it impractical for on the road.<br /><br />I finally found another use for the five and a half boxes I had left of the stuff after giving up on the protein water idea. I add about a third of a package to a container of plain yogurt or kefir.  After a minute or two it is completely dissolved and has added a little sweetness and nutrition for an added ten calories.

Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate. Although the price is high, the dogs eat less of this than regular dog food, so it really does not cost as much more as it seems.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price and very fresh product, but I prefer to support local pet stores and purchase it locally when it is available.'],\n",

Yes even the so-called split-membrane chlorella made me just as sick.  EDTA did not make me throw up but made me so nauseous I had to stop taking it.  I had no problem whatsoever with the sodium alginate.  I bought some empty capsules (large), fill them up, and take one or two a day.  From the start my mental clarity has improved.  Without the constant brain fog I can actually plan and get things done.  It is not a miracle improvement but I can tell the difference. I do take cilantro sometimes too which is helping to get it out of the tissues, and then the alginate binds to it to flush it out of the body so it doesn't just recirculate.  I still have one huge filling left which for various reasons I am not ready to have taken out right now.  So I don't want to take huge doses of anything that will start pulling mercury out of the filling.  The sodium alginate is gentle with no side effects. As far as physical symptoms that might be tied into the mercury, they are improving gradually. (Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, adrenal fatigue.)\"],\n",

The true mix of ingredients of this mix also includes 1)Sea Salt 2)red bell pepper 3)Green bell pepper 4) Garlic 5) Black pepper .... So it is not true to what they are selling it as!! However I love it!! I am very happy with it and will buy again! I just want you to know that there are some extra ingredients in it that some people would not want or would be happy with. My only negative is that the salt is pretty overpowering for the way I intended to use it! I like to put lots of garlic and pepper on my food but with the salt you can only put so much on before your dish is like swollowing mouthfuls of sea water!! (I am trying to post?) I have posted some pictures so you can see exactly what I am telling you. I think this was a very good deal for all that I got (12 pack ), but the mix is not just Garlic & Pepper and is cut with salt,green & red bell peppers!! I try and eat healthy and I love french fries!! I have come up with the next best thing... I microwave a potato then slice it like home fries then cover with very much katchup & my Garlic Pepper spice and I got A healthy snack without the deep fried fat and sat. fat!! See my pictures and I hope this helps somebody!!<br />  I forgot to add that the grinder on each bottle works very well and is awesome to have it ground as you need it! I think it helps save much of the flavor sealed inside the garlic and pepper. I find the garlic has a better taste than that powdered garlic they sell everywhere. Also I think I only paid the $12.50ish and the shipping was either lower or free?? I do remembe thinking it came out to a little over a buck each when I bought this 12-pack. My total order was close to $60.00 so I might have gotten free shipping with that?? Either way it still is a fair deal for a good product. One last thing is a 12-pack seems like alot, however it goes fairly quick... not like pepper corns that seem to last forever... This spice mix comes out in nice sized chunks. I am on my 5th bottle and I am one person, who loves Garlic & Pepper!!'],\n",

While Watermelon is sweet-sweet, Apple is sweet-tart and will literally make your mouth water. As with all JR candies, you can smell them before you open them and the scent is a huge temptation.

I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the store and lasts a long time because I won't give my cats very many at a time. I only give them no more than 1-2 a day as apposed to the recommended 6-8, which is just crazy. It would be nice if pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food. They smell really gross to me but my cat loves it. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have a beneficial dental ingredient either, but they are crunchy and they do have vitamins in them, so they are much better than these.<br /><br />Pros\"],\n",

That being said, this mix seems to be great. I have so far only made the Atkins recipe biscuits, but I ate them and enjoyed them and so did my boyfriend who isn't even doing Atkins. It seems you do have to keep an eye on whatever you are baking when using this mix, and probably cook it a little less time so that it doesn't over-cook. The biscuit recipe said to cook for 10-15 minutes at 425; they took under 10 mins. Next time I will probably cook them a little lower for a little longer. I am very pleased that not only does the mix give you the lower carbs, but also such high amounts of protein! The biscuit recipe advises that there are 2.5g net carbs in each biscuit. Where else can you find a biscuit like that?! I can't wait to try muffins, pancakes, cookies, etc. I'm glad that I got this on Amazon through the subscribe and save option. It is much cheaper and you get free shipping for all your shipments. I will more than likely keep this on for delivery every 1-2 months. I really think this could be a life-saver for me.

Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you\\'ll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy\\'s starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker\\'s sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy\\'s bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy\\'s that makes <a href=\"http'],\n",

I was feeding her 3 times a day, a quarter cup each, and she started growing really fast. When she hit 10 pounds, I dropped down to twice a day, still a quarter cup each. Eventually she got to 13 pounds and was starting to look pudgy. I dropped her down to a quarter cup in the morning and half of that at night, and she\\'s stayed consistent at about 11 pounds and well proportioned. That\\'s about half of what the bag says a cat of her age and weight \"should\" eat. I feel that if she ate all that she would get fat.<br /><br />Watch how much you feed your cat, adjust portions to their activity level, and be sure they have plenty of water.

I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.

       "  \" I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product.\"],\n",

       "  \" In my search for a healthful food my cats really love and will thrive on, I've tried giving them many different premium brands of cat foods...grain free, and using only animal proteins (no plant proteins like soy products). My cats have sampled brands that include vegetables and sometimes rice, but no other grains in the recipe. I've done taste test trials on them comparing other brands with Fussy Cat.  My cats (adults as well as weaned kittens) absolutely prefer the Fussy Cat Chicken & Tuna recipe. In comparison to the other Fussy Cat flavors, the Chicken & Tuna takes top honors with my cats.<br /><br />After doing research on cat (and dog) diets, I agree with the results of recent studies that conclude that cats (and dogs) are biologically evolved dedicated carnivores who require animal based proteins.  Therefore I avoid, as much as possible, cat (and dog) foods that use plant based proteins, grains, and plant based fillers.  Plant proteins do not contain all the essential amino acids that carnivores like cats (and dogs) require. Additionally, plant proteins are difficult for cats (and dogs) to digest. Over time the difficulty and stress on the animal's digestive system can result in health issues and a shorter life span.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that animal protein quality is diminished with high temperature cooking (used in preparing dry kibble and most canned pet foods), I supplement my cats' Fussy Cat meals with some cooked organic egg yolk, and sometimes with an added tablespoon of raw organic beef hamburger (sold at Costco in Novato, CA).  To ensure their fur remains soft and shiny, I always add to their food the contents of a 1000mg capsule of Pure Alaska Omega brand 100% Natural Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil.  Just puncture the capsule and squeeze the contents onto their food and stir thoroughly.<br /><br />I take my animals to a holisitic veterinarian (Pamela Bouchard, DVM of Tender Care Veterinary Hospital, San Rafael, CA), who strongly believes that diet is an essential foundation for maintaining optimum health and longevity in animals. With each bi-annual check-up, we review the diet of each of my pets. Depending on the results of the always thorough exam (including blood work, etc.), my veterinarian may recommend certain supplements and holistic remedies tailored to meet each pet's requirements.<br /><br />Now if I could find a human medical doctor who would do the same for me with as much care and compassion, I'd be a happy cat.\"],\n",

(Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis\"],\n",

The result is that they take longer to cook; rolled oats take about 10 minutes to get mushy all the way through, but steel cut oats can take up to 30 minutes to get soft and will probably never be as mushy as rolled oats.

I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s unpleasant, but it\\'s present.<br /><br />But, over time I\\'ve used the whole bottle, and it\\'s grown on me. It is pretty refreshing, and adds a good boost to a normal glass of water. So I went from \"okay\" to actually liking it. So I boosted it to four stars.<br /><br />The flavor does avoid that chemical taste that some of these enhancers seem to have.<br /><br />The vitamins are a benefit, though I\\'m never sure if the benefit offsets the chemicals and sucralose ingredients.<br /><br />I noticed no extra \\'energy,\\' but I don\\'t really notice when I drink a soda either. It\\'s just sort of \\'there.\\' Which is better than being jittery, and since this has taurine, like Red Bull, I was wondering about that - did not happen, though, and that\\'s good. Ultimately, \\'energy\\' is subjective and difficult to define from person to person.<br /><br />The drink does at least some of what it says it will do - it gives flavor to water, and apparently does provide vitamins. It tastes pretty good, and adds some life to boring tap water. But, if you\\'re caffeine-sensitive, it\\'s probably best used in morning and early afternoon.<br /><br />As I said, I\\'ve updated this as of July 15, from my original three stars to four stars.'],\n",

We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most.  This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks.  It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins.  We even found a diabetic powder that you can mix with ice, fresh strawberries, some of this flavoring, and skim milk and then blend into a dietetic strawberry shake.  If you freeze your strawberries and add in a little Splenda® then the taste is really good.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found.  They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!'],\n",

Anyway, the first time I put just a small spoonful of RGDC\\'s Beefy Rice over their dry food, our trio made it perfectly clear that this was absolutely the BEST food they\\'ve ever had, even better than the Pork & Pasta that they loved!  Noses buried in their bowls, tails wagging while they ate, and not a drop or morsel left behind!!  Now, I am notified early every morning by Sturgis that it\\'s time to get up and make breakfast.  And in the afternoon, he does the same thing.  EMDD makes us dizzy with her spinning \"I\\'m-so-happy\" dance.

I loved the light smell and the thick smooth texture of both.  I had no problems rinsing out either the shampoo or the conditioner.  As my hair was drying (I let my hair air dry rather than blow dry) I could just feel the softness settling in.  I have this weird habit of ruffling and fluffing my hair as it dries and after using this product, my hair had such a great feel to it as I did so.<br /><br />Once dry, my hair settles nicely with no wild/static craziness and looks smooth and soft.  I have long hair - below my shoulders - and it sometimes likes to go the crazy route.  Also, one of the things I miss most about my youth (granted, I am only 38) is the incredibly thick hair that I once had.  Once I began having children, my hair thinned quite a bit and I miss that thick mop, lol.  In any case, this product does seem to give it volume and \"plump\" up my hair.<br /><br />I also want to be sure to mention that I have weird/picky hair/scalp.  It responds to different products in an extreme way.  My scalp is oily, while my length is more dry.  When I use hair products it either leaves my hair a limp mass of yuck or works really well.  Most of the time, it leaves a limp mass.  Needless to say, I was thrilled and pleased to find that the Clear product left my hair looking and feeling great.  I am also one that has to wash my hair daily - in the morning, otherwise it looks oily and feels horrible.  I notice with this, however, I can wash my hair one day and the next morning it does not have that oily look and feel to it!  Yay!<br /><br />At the price, I feel this is a great product and one that I will continue to use for a while.  The scent is great, the effect is great and I am very pleased with the outcome when I use the shampoo and conditioner combination!'],\n",

       "  ' OMG. I am SO relieved. I\\'ve just taken my first few sips and I HAD to come and post a review. I\\'ve had this tea sitting around for weeks, frankly out of fear of it\\'s taste. I read the reviews here and in other places. Descriptions like \"earthy\" and \"mushroom\" had me gagging at the thought of drinking the tea. I do NOT like mushrooms and \"earthy\" is a very vague description.<br /><br />That being said (this review is strictly about the taste. I will post later if I truly notice any health benefits) there is a subtle taste it that can only be described as earthy. Probably the way you\\'d imagine tree bark to taste. Not horrible, but nothing to drool about. I don\\'t taste mushroom at all. The flavor is SUPER mild. It\\'s not strong so it\\'s almost pleasant to drink. Although the tree bark doesn\\'t make my taste buds do a happy dance, I\\'m not gagging. I didn\\'t need to add sweetener to my tea, and I can drink this every morning from now on with no problem. I have been trying to wean myself from coffee to tea and this is a good compromise IF it can wake me up in the mornings. The earthiness of the tea almost gives the satisfaction of drinking a cup of coffee that\\'s not quite sweet enough. If you don\\'t like sweetener in your coffee, you will probably enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I didn\\'t time the brew. I have one of those 16 oz insulated cups with the tea diffuser inside. I filled the diffuser (not sure if it holds 1 oz. or 2) and I put hot water in the cup. I gave it 2-3 minutes then poured out the (light reddish) water and put in new water. It immediately became dark red. About 3-5 minutes later, I threw away the tea leaves.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure if I made mine too weak since I used a big cup. Maybe I should let it steep for 6-10 minutes? Also, I have to check to see if I used enough...or even too much tea. I\\'ll play with it to make sure I\\'m getting the maximum health benefit but for now, don\\'t be afraid to taste it! It\\'s not horrible. No lingering after taste. If you don\\'t like it, you\\'ll forget it within 30 seconds of having tasted it.<br /><br />Go ahead, take the chance.'],\n",

       "  \"ReviewText: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.\\n\"]]"
